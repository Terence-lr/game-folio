Create an underwater fish portfolio game called “Gamefolio” with these specifications:
PROJECT SETUP:
	•	HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript project structure
	•	Use Three.js CDN (latest version) for 3D graphics
	•	Mobile-first responsive design
	•	Basic file structure: index.html, style.css, script.js
CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
	1.	Basic 3D Scene:
	•	Underwater environment with blue gradient background
	•	Simple ocean floor plane
	•	Basic ambient lighting
	•	Perspective camera that follows the fish
	2.	Fish Character:
	•	Simple 3D fish model (use basic geometry - no complex models needed)
	•	Fish should face movement direction
	•	Basic swimming animation (subtle tail movement)
	•	Starts at center of scene
	3.	Movement Controls:
	•	Arrow keys for desktop: up/down/left/right movement
	•	WASD as alternative
	•	Space bar for speed boost
	•	Smooth movement with momentum
	4.	Mobile Controls (Priority):
	•	Virtual joystick in bottom-left corner (circular with center dot)
	•	Boost button in bottom-right corner
	•	Touch and drag for camera rotation
	•	Responsive design that works on phones
	5.	Simple Portfolio Sections:
	•	Create 3-4 basic colored cube objects as placeholders for portfolio sections
	•	Position them around the underwater scene
	•	When fish gets close to a cube, show a simple HTML overlay with placeholder text
	•	Each cube should have different colors (coral, kelp green, shipwreck brown, crystal blue)
	6.	Basic UI:
	•	Clean, minimal interface
	•	Instructions overlay that can be dismissed
	•	Section navigation hints
	•	Mobile-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
	•	Keep it simple and functional - focus on the core navigation experience
	•	Use CSS for styling, not complex 3D materials initially
	•	Ensure smooth 30fps on mobile devices
	•	Add basic error handling for unsupported browsers
	•	Include console logs for debugging movement and interactions
STYLING NOTES:
	•	Dark underwater theme with deep blues
	•	Clean, modern UI elements
	•	High contrast for mobile readability
	•	Crimson accent color for interactive elements
START WITH:
	•	Get the fish moving smoothly in 3D space first
	•	Add mobile controls second
	•	Then add basic portfolio section placeholders
	•	Focus on the core navigation feeling good
Please create a working prototype that I can immediately test the fish movement and mobile controls. Keep the code clean and well-commented so I can easily modify and expand it later.
